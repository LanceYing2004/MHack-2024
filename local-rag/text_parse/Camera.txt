THE CAMERA MATRIX This problem describes how to use linear algebra to describe the world as seen through a camera.The camera matrix.When we describe coordinates ( x, y, z ) on 3-dimensional space, we take they-axis to point up.We start with the camera at the origin of the ( x, y, z ) coordinate system, pointing along the positive z-axis (so parallel to the ground), and held in its ordinary orientation.The camera will draw the pointhxy zi at the pointh x/z y/zi on the image pane.The camera starts at the origin, pointing along the z-axis Problem 1 Explain whyh x/z y/zi is the correct formula.We now move the camera to positionhp q ri , while keeping it pointing in the same direction (parallel to the zaxis) and held upright.The camera has been displaced tohp q ri , still pointing parallel to the z-axis Problem 2 Where will the pointhxy zi be drawn now?
(Note that your answer will include the variables p,q,r,x,yandz.) 1 2 THE CAMERA MATRIX We now keep the camera at positionhp q ri and continue to hold it upright, but swivel an angle θ around the vertical axis through the camera position, turning toward the positive x-axis. In other words, we pan horizontally.The camera has been rotated by θaround a vertical axis Problem 3 Where will the pointhxy zi be drawn now?(Note that your answer will include the angle θ, as well as the variables p,q,r,x,yandz.) We’ll now want to distinguish two coordinate systems.The first coordinate system keeps the origin at a fixed point in space, with the y-axis pointing straight up.The second coordinate system, (u, v, w ), is relative to the camera.The uandvaxes are in the plane of the camera, parallel to its vertical and horizontal orientation respectively, and the w-axis points straight out of the camera.Theu,v,wcoordinates are centered on the camera, and relative to its orientation.
So, in the first problem, the two origins were together andhuvwi =hxy zi . Problem 4 Express the ( u, v, w ) coordinates in terms of the ( x, y, z ) coordinates in the scenarios of problems 2 and 3.So the point at coordinateshuvwi is always plotted at positionh u/w v/wi .When you considered translating the camera to positionhp q ri , you should have found that the formulas expressing the ( u, v, w ) coordinates in terms of the ( x, y, z ) coordinates were not purely linear.To fix this, we introduce the notion of the camera matrix P.This is a 3 ×4 matrix P such that u v w =P x y z 1 .Problem 5 Compute the camera matrices for the two scenarios in the previous problems: The camera translated tohp q ri , and the camera translated to that position and then rotated θaround a vertical axis.Reconstructing the camera matrix.Suppose we know the coordinates of a number of points in space, and we would like to determine where the camera was placed.
